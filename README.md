## Devlog
Normally I stick with the "building blocks" method of explaining things, but if pressed to reword it in another way I might describe the relationship between everything as like food.
Components would be like the more individual ingredients that when compiled together make up a dish or a GameObject, similar to how an assortment of vegetables and meats in a broth become a soup.
An assortment of dishes or GameObjects might make up a banquet or a feast which can also be seen as the Scene.
